# github-issues-project

Hi, it's my recruitment project :)
It's made with expo react-native.
Actually i think it's all done from task requirements except one thing.
I couldn't find out solution, how to get token for api, so i decided just to add it to enviromental variable with .env file: GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx.
I resolve saving comments with persist and AsyncStorage from community package. Actually i didn't set it up before, so google helped me a lot ^^
